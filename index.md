## Exercise: Flying Blind ‚úàÔ∏è

Pick a website you work on. Run it through each of these tools, keeping each open in separate tabs:

1. **Lighthouse** (DevTools audit tab, only check performance)
2. **PageSpeed Insights** [developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
3. **WebPageTest** [webpagetest.org/easy](http://webpagetest.org/easy)
4. **Test My Site** [testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com](https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com)
5. **RespImageLint** [ausi.github.io/respimagelint/](https://ausi.github.io/respimagelint/) (requires some set up)

Note: **Discussion**: What do you notice about each? What are the similarities/differences? What do you like/dislike?

# üìà Metrics üìà <!-- .element: class="highlighter-light" -->

---

> When optimizing for speed, <br>**user experience** should always <br>be your primary metric.

---

## User experience

1. When can I see the page? <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
2. When can I interact with it? <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
3. Is it delightful? <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

Note: By delightful I mean both is it stable and smooth.

---

## When can I see the page?

- Speed index measures how quickly the page contents are visually populated, but it's not simple<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Largest contentful paint measures when the largest image or text paint in the viewport occurs<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
  - Removed elements are invalidated (splash screens)<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
  - Larger weight in Lighthouse<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

<small>[Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/), [Speed Index](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index)</small>

---

## When can I interact with the page?

<small>End to End Apps with Polymer by Kevin Schaaf, Polymer Summit 2017</small>

---

## When can I interact with the page?

- Time to Interactive (TTI) measures how long it takes a page to become fully interactive<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Total blocking time (TBT) measures the time between First Contentful Paint (FCP) and TTI where the main thread was blocked for long enough to prevent input responsiveness.<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- First Input Delay (FID) measures the delta between when an input event is received and when the main thread is next idle (field only).<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Large blocks of scripting on the main thread makes interaction worse.<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

<small>[How does TBT relate to TTI?](https://web.dev/tbt/#how-does-tbt-relate-to-tti), [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/)</small>

Note: the point at which layout has stabilized, key webfonts are visible, and the main thread is available enough to handle user input within 50ms. The main thread is considered "blocked" any time there's a Long Task‚Äîa task that runs on the main thread for more than 50 milliseconds (ms). TBT will have a larger weight in Lighthouse.

---

## Is it delightful? Visual Stability...

<video controls width="800" autoplay loop>
  <source src="./images/layout-shift.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>

---

## Cumulative Layout Shift** (CLS)

> measures the sum total of all individual layout shift scores for every unexpeceted layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of the page.

<small>[From web.dev](https://web.dev/cls/)</small>

---

## Is it smooth? Frame Rate...

<img src="./images/frames_per_second.gif" alt="Frames per second comparison for visual jank" class="no-outline">

Note: Frame rate or frames per second (fps), is one measure of responsiveness. Modern devices refresh their screens at a rate of 60 fps. Converting that to an individual frame, we theoretically have 16 ms to render. In actuality, the browser needs some of that time, so we should target 10ms per frame. Any more, and the human eye will be able to detect the jank or jitter.

---

## RAIL model for performance goals

- **Response**: process events in under 50ms
- **Animation**: produce a frame in 10ms (for 60fps devices)
- **Idle**: maximize idle time (to respond in 50ms or less)
- **Load**: deliver content and become interactive in under 5 seconds, 2 seconds for subsequent loads*

<small>[Measure Performance with the RAIL Model](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail)</small>

Note: R:Complete a transition initiated by user input within 100ms. A: Have 16ms, but browsers need about 6ms to render each frame. I: Maximize idle time to increase the odds that the page responds to user input within 50ms. L:on mid-range mobile devices with slow 3G connections

---

## Core Web Vitals

<img src="./images/core_web_vitals.png" class="plain">

<small>[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/), [The Science Behind Web Vitals](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html)</small>

Note: Target is 75% of loads. "Core Web Vitals are the subset of Web Vitals that apply to all web pages, should be measured by all site owners, and will be surfaced across all Google tools. Each of the Core Web Vitals represents a distinct facet of the user experience, is measurable in the field, and reflects the real-world experience of a critical user-centric outcome."

---

## Exercise: Metrics

Look at the tools you ran earlier, and write down:

1. The site's speed index, LCP, TTI, TBT, FID, and CLS.
2. Which tools did you find them in?
3. Under what conditions were these run (device, network, emulated/real?

<img class="nooutline" width="80%" src="./images/no_extensions.png" alt="Chrome extensions negatively affected this page's load performance. Try auditing the page in incognito mode or from a Chrome profile without extensions.">

---

1. Set up a new Chrome profile with __no extensions__.
2. Open **Dev Tools > Settings > Experiments**, hit **shift** 6 times, turn on:
  - Timeline: event initiators (shows repaint caused by x)
  - Automatically pretty print...
  - Enable CSS grid debugging
  - Input events on Timeline overview
  - Timeline: invalidation tracking (like inline styles)
3. Restart Dev Tools (alt + r)

Note: Incognito can't test cache or long-term sessions

---

## Dev Tools High-Level Orientation

- **Network**: download time (waterfall)
- **Performance**: script and other execution costs (flame chart)
- **Lighthouse**: scores performance, PWAs, accessibility, etc.
- **Coverage**: shows used vs. unused bytes includes in the load

Note: Lots of other cool tools exist like local overrides, paint layers, etc.

---

## Chrome Dev Tools Network Tab

<img class="no-outline" src="./images/network-tab-annotated.png">

Note: Use **large request rows** to make size and time columns show more data. The size column now shows size over the wire (top) and size of the file put into the browser cache (bottom). For example, jpeg would have added headers and cookies. Time column now shows total elapsed time(top) and latency plus wait time (bottom). Subtracting the two gives download time (click then go to Timing to see actual download times). **sorting and filtering**: Click on a column header to sort. Use the filter box to only show .jpg or files from a specific domain. Use the minus sign for ‚Äúnot‚Äù, e.g. -domain: mydomain.com (useful for 3rd party search). Type just - to see all possibilities. **Right-click on the column headers** and enable the Priority column. Notice that HTML and CSS are highest. Images vary on placement, and JavaScript varies. Be careful: Scripts after images get deprioritized and iframe widgets can prioritize to highest because of the file type. **preview stuff from next slide**.

---

## Tricks + shortcuts

- **cmd + shift + p** searches settings like "Show/hide third party badges" and ‚ÄúCoverage‚Äù
- **magical shift key** - shift and hover over files: red shows the files downloaded by the file hovered, and green shows the file that initiated the download of the file hovered
- **Performance tab/flame chart**: Scroll up/down (zoom in/out), left/right (right/left). Keyboard shortcuts w/s (zoom in/out) and a/d (move right/left).
- **cmd + e**: start/stop recording
- **cmd + alt + f**: project-wide search
- **cmd + shift + o**: in sources tab in a CSS file, finds a selector

---

## WebPageTest Waterfall

<img class="no-outline" src="./images/wpt-waterfall-annotated.png">

Note: green - downloaded before started rendering so these files could be bottlenecks for rendering (js or css). Thumbnail view: scrolling moves the red line, gold border = visual change happened. https://webpagetest.org/result/200525_57_18cda7ecd946450919406f43121c34d0/

---

## Look for patterns of poor performance...

---

<img class="no-outline" src="./images/http1.png">

Note: No cert so HTTP1 can only download 6-ish files at once.

---

<img class="no-outline" src="./images/many-connections.png">

Note: Many connections to different domains.

---

<img class="no-outline" src="./images/chained-requests.png">

Note: Chained critical path/request depth - one file calling the next file calling the next.

---

<img class="no-outline" src="./images/req-depth-etc.png">

---

<img class="no-outline" src="./images/css-blocking-js-annotated.png">

Note: Is the script critical? If not, async/defer. If so, put before CSS.

---

By default, scripts are HTML parser blocking.

<img class="plain" src="./images/asyncdefer1.svg">

<small>[HTML spec: scripting](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html)</small>

---

`defer` downloads without blocking, then waits to execute after the document is parsed. `defer` scripts are executed in order.

<img class="plain" src="./images/asyncdefer2.svg">

<small>[HTML spec: scripting](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html)</small>

Note: Scripts with the defer attribute will execute in the order in which they appear in the document.

---

`async` downloads without blocking, then executes right away, blocking HTML parsing.

<img class="plain" src="./images/asyncdefer3.svg">

<small>[HTML spec: scripting](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html)</small>

Note: Scripts with the defer attribute will execute in the order in which they appear in the document.

---

`type=module` is deferred by default unless given an `async` attribute.
