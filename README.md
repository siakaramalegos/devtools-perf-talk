# Intro to Serverless Functions Using Netlify, a mini-workshop

Serverless functions are a key skill to know when moving to Jamstack applications or serverless architecture. Going serverless means having no server to manage while also having the ability to scale infinitely.

In this workshop, we'll start with a basic, static Eleventy website then build in dynamic features like form handling and secure API access using serverless functions. We'll use the Netlify CLI to set up our dev environment and deploy to production on Netlify. You must understand vanilla JavaScript and HTML and be familiar with running npm scripts to attend this workshop.

The demo code can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/siakaramalegos/serverless-netlify-demo).
